Design Tenants:

1: Is the idea, focus, decision needed? If not, remove it.
2: Is the idea, focus, decision fun? If not, remove it.
3: Historicity is important.
4: If it's not in the timeframe is it still possible? If not, remove it.
5: Is the idea, focus, decision adding modifiers for the sake of it? If so, remove it. Random tech bonuses and amry bonuses that make no sense aren't fun.
6: Memes and jokes are ok in moderation, they should be a reward for strange outcomes. Having a decision to put trump as God Emperor? Remove it. Having to take the Archaeology tech and have good relations with several countries and negotiate? Include it.
7: Alt-hist should be realistic. Lois XVI fist fighting Robbespierre to win isn't good. Having him successfully escape to Louisiana, is.
8: Alt-hist paths should require sacrifice and hard work. It shouldn't just be pressing a button on a focus and suddenly everyone is Monarchist in the USA.
9: Have fun while making your ideas, if it is tedious, sit back and speak to the other devs. A bored dev makes boring focuses.
10: Focus on keeping the mod 70% serious.
11: Smaller, focused trees are better than sprawling unfocused messes. Don't be like RT56 and have 50 focuses for the army tree that no one reads.

If in doubt, ask me or another Dev.
