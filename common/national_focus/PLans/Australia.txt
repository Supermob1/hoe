Situation at start:
Penal colony (small number of officers, mostly penal slaves)
Sick Natives (and angry ones)
Isolated (No steady supplies)
No Army
Food Shortages (no agriculture) and poor sustenance of convicts
Unsecure political situation



What actually happened:
Led by Arthur Phillip
Second Fleet arrived, but worsened the situation as brought more sick and malnourished
Sent to find better soils in the Parramatta region. However, poor equipment and unfamiliar soils led to weak farming.
Building programme assisted by convict labour (Could have it as decisions, and can lead to a rebellion)
