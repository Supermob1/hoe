PLANNED FOCUS TREE LINES

Have the king survive -

Reform the kings personal guard
Alliance with Austria or Have Signed the Brunswick Agreements
Maria-Antouette must be alive
In the Flight must go through an event chain, Heavy carriage or light carriage (if heavy both die if caught, if light only one will die but both can be caught)
Montmedy must be owned by France

If you own Lousiana from Spain then the King becomes ruler of a new Kingdom of Louisiana (New Focus Tree)

If not then an option to flee to either Prussia or Austria.
