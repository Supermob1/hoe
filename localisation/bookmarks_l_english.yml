 the_revolution_NAME:0 "The French Revolution"
 the_revolution_DESC:0 "Dark times are coming. The French Monarchy is woefully inept, while Louis XVI has been put into a Constitutional monarchy, the Bastille lies in ruins and the Rights of Man have been declared. Many still see the power of the Church and King to be too high. Meanwhile the Austrian monarch and Holy Roman Emperor plans to strike at any sign of weakness in France, with England in tow it could prevent the rise of Liberalism in Europe. However, many in France lie in anticipation in order to gain power through fear, hope or ability."
 HITTING_FAN_NAME:0 "The Hitting of the Fan"
 HITTING_FAN_DESC:0 "Yup, that's right! That umbrella collection is about to come in real handy."
 FRA_THE_REVOLUTION_DESC:0 "France is among the oldest Kingdoms in Europe, its Ancien Regime however is being challenged by a new wave of thought, that of Rationalism and Liberalism. The Peasants are in riot and many are working behind the scenes to improve their political prestige and power. Will the constitutional monarchy succeed or will it fall into chaos, or perhaps the ancient powers of old will return to the King?"
 SWE_THE_REVOLUTION_DESC:0 "Sweden is in great peril. Her once mighty Empire is falling, and traitors are conspiring within her shady cabinets and officer halls. While Gustav III's war in Russia is at a standstill, many of her officers are actively revolting. Her lands in Germany are also further at risk to a new Prussian power. Can Svea Rike unite the North and reclaim her lost Empire?"
 ENG_THE_REVOLUTION_DESC:0 "A mere child is Prime Minister, the King is mad and the Colonies are still  bloody revolting. Yet the British are standing with a stoic look and stiff upper lip at the machinations going on inside Europe. Should the Brits abandon the Mainland and instead look outwards to gain power, or will they finally return the Kingdom of France to its rightful owner? All they know for now however, is that Britain's Wooden Wall certainly rules the waves."
 PRU_THE_REVOLUTION_DESC:0 "With Fredericus Rex's rule we have reached an unprecedented height, we have emerged as a Great Power in Germany and Europe. Will his enlightened vision be continued through his son Frederick William II? Could we form a federation of North German States, or perhaps even all Germans? Will Austria be our ally or our foe, and what of France? Its political crisis will surely be contained. Is it time for a new Germany, away from the traditions of old?"
 AUS_THE_REVOLUTION_DESC:0 "The Habsburgs rule a land not united by language, politics, history or creed. No, they hold a land united by marriage. Can they bring their land a disunified states together? Or will the Hungarians, already crying for Freedom get their way? Can a compromise be discovered even while at war with the Turk? While the seeds of revolution are planted in her own country, she looks out as an arbiter of Europe to keep the peace among the French, who are looking to revolution which would upset the balance of the World. Can the Emperors of Europe halt a new power from rising?"
 TUR_THE_REVOLUTION_DESC:0 "When the Turks first arrived in Europe they could never have imagined the marvelous Empire they would create. From the Arabian sea to the Black, the Ottomans have conquered it all through military might and political prowess. But with the Northern barbarians threatening the Sultanate of Rome, the Eyalets gaining power at an alarming rate and the Janissaries getting more and more complacent as the years go on. Has the all powerful empire developed a cold or is it the Black Death?"
 SOV_THE_REVOLUTION_DESC:0 "The Russian Empire is no longer a backwater, this new prosperous state has dragged itself into the modern ages through sheer force and will. Can the works of Peter and Catherine continue to lead to a great age for Russia or will her magnificant Empire collapse into obscurity as an example of a ruined state? Can she defeat the invaders to the North, so desperate to cling onto their failing Empire while also battling the greatest threat to Europe since time immemorial and carve out a Third Rome?"
 OTHER_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Nations of the World are in turmoil, the new waves of Liberalism and Utopianism have reached every corner of the globe. Imperial powers threaten safe positions in Asia and the American governments are looking the USA as a beacon of independence. All nations across the world will need to decide their future, will they launch their own empires from the ashes of Europe or be absorbed into the growing European powers?"
 POL_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:1 "After centuries in which the Polish nation has been divided between three empires, Poland now stands independent once again. But its position is not an easy one. \n\nIn the east, the Soviet Union has not forgotten the humiliating defeat in the Polish-Soviet war. \n\nIn the west, German Führer Adolf Hitler makes no secret of his desire for more "living space" - and that the former German areas now under Polish control will be the first step to achieve it."
 RAJ_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The crown jewel of the British Empire, the Raj of India is a strange combination of imperial power and imperial powerlessness. A tiny elite of British civil servants rule over a vast subcontinent filled with hundreds of millions of subjects. From their ranks recruits the Indian Army, which fought bravely in the Great War.\n\nIndian leaders hoped that the sacrifices made in the last war would help India gain her independence from Britain, but so far, that hope has been disappointed. With a new war looming, many believe that the time has come to take that freedom - by whatever means necessary."
